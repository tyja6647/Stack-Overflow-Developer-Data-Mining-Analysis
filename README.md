# Stack-Overflow-Developer-Data-Mining-Analysis
This project focuses on data mining techniques applied to the Stack Overflow Developer Survey(https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/), extracting meaningful insights from developer responses. Using data processing, analysis, and visualization methods, we identify trends in programming language preferences, career satisfaction, salary distributions, and skill adoption. The project leverages Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn) and machine learning models to uncover patterns that influence hiring decisions and workplace dynamics. The repository includes Jupyter notebooks, preprocessing scripts, and documentation for reproducing results.
